# HEAVY
* > ADD: a way to calibrate HL finger without keyboard
** Ideally use PC GUI dropdown and RPC
* > UI: Remove PC UI
* ADD on HL the state of the current pointer (can be finger color; or just text)



* Effects Menu
** >> BUG: Scale centering
** > BUG: draw effects ? changing drawing color I think causes a crash because can't change other draw effects
** Button: put it on the hand, and/or in the main buttons
** >> GUI quick: "click chart to control channel" remove ?
** >> Plugins: GUI quick: "plugins GUIs"





# QUICK
* > Example arduino scene: Manual Data Channel make it smaller

# SOON
* > TEST: Scenes load/save/next
* >> Button on hand for erase all drawings [have RPC already]

# AT END
* >> Clean up example scenes folder
* >> Example docs: Color cube, text cube


# MAYBE

** Plugins: remove additional plugins ?
** > Plugins: activating plugins has weird GUI popups; also make sure the populs show near the plugins menu

* EffectsMenu Make networked UI so all users see it appear/disappear and closed
** do this for Objects Menus also

* Phone UI/RPC for swithing into a specific scene [not sure if this is possible because phone tries to start in specific place]
